# Cryptography
#### Cryptography - final project 
#### November 12, 2019

**Title:**
Swiss Army Cryptographic Tool set for Beginners

**Goal:**
The goal was to create a python command line interface (CLI) application that incorporates three cryptographic algorithms for the user to try out and interact with. 

**Technologies Used:**
Python, [cryptography.io package](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), SHA256, Elliptic Curve (ECC)

**Result:**
At the end, I created a report that you can find, which includes information regarding the project. From the installation process, running the application, and screenshots outlining the process that the user would take to interact with the program. 
The appendix part of the report showcases the Python code that was used to create the application.
